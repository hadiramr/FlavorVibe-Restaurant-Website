**Project Description: FlavorVibe Restaurant Management System**

The Restaurant Management System is a full-stack web application built with PHP (Laravel) and MySQL. It streamlines restaurant operations by offering users features like menu browsing, table booking, and profile management. Admins can manage menu items, view and approve bookings, and handle user data via an admin panel.

### **Back-End:**
- **User Authentication**: Normal users and admins can register and log in.
- **Menu Management**: Admins can add, delete, or update menu items.
- **Table Booking**: Users can book tables, and admins manage bookings.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update personal details.
- **Admin Controls**: Admins manage users and bookings, and update the menu.

This project enhances the dining experience by simplifying reservations and restaurant management.
